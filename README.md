# Bank_Loan_Analysis
#I provide the link of my analysis in order to verify my project. However due to the reason that I made my dashboards floating and used my own backround, when opening the link it does not seem pretty this is why I added some screenshots of my job. I hope you find this analysis interesting.

Description: This analysis is about bank loan applications and it is divided in three dashboards. The first one is the 'Summary' dashboard where there are analyzed some KPIs separated in 'good' and 'bad' loans. The second one is the 'Overview' dashboard analyzing in depth the loan applications and the third dashboard called 'Details' includes all the factors that have previously analyzed per application id.
